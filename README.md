# finalWeb
Final project upon completion of EPAM courses. Project theme: Online School. 
Three roles are implemented: Administrator, Teacher, Student. The teacher manages courses: creates a course, sets the start 
and finish of the course, can change course data, sets the course status (preparation, start, finish). 
A student can view all available courses, enroll in any course of interest, or cancel an enrollment.
The administrator can view all courses, view enrolled students and teachers, can delete a course, add a new subject. 
The guest can view available courses, register as a student or teacher.
